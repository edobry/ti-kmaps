K-Map Challenge game written in TI-BASIC, copied from my TI-83 for posterity

Instructions for use
--

Copy all programs into your TI-83/84 manually (sorry, don't have a data cable or I'd figure out how to bundle them up.)
You can ignore all programs beginning with `KS`, as those were a preliminary attempt at automatic scoring.

Make sure to copy over Pic0
  - Turn off axes
    - `2nd`+`ZOOM`, `AxesOff`
  - Select the`Pen` tool
    - `2nd`+`PRGM`, `UP`, `ENTER`
  - Draw the lines from Pic0 EXACTLY.
  - Save the drawing
    - `2nd`+`PRGM`, `LEFT`, `ENTER`, `0`, `ENTER`

Special characters
--
  - `π`: `2nd`+`^`
  - `e`: `2nd`+`÷`
  - `θ`: `ALPHA`+`3`
  - `\L`: `2nd`+`STAT`, `OPS`, `UP`, `ENTER`
