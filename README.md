========

K-Map Challenge game written in TI-BASIC, copied from my TI-83 for posterity

Instructions for use
--

Copy all programs into your TI-83/84 manually (sorry, don't have a data cable or I'd figure out how to bundle them up.)
You can ignore all programs beginning with `KS`, as those were a preliminary attempt at automatic scoring.
Make sure to copy over Pic0 (turn of axes and use the `DRAW` menu with the Pen tool).

Special characters
--
  - `π`: 2nd+^
  - `e`: 2nd+÷
  - `θ`: ALPHA+3
  - `\L`: 2nd+STAT, OPS, UP, ENTER
